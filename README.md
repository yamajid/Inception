# Docker Infrastructure Project: Inception

## Project Description
A comprehensive infrastructure setup leveraging Docker containerization technology to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable multi-service environment.

## 💫 Core Components

### 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
- **Container Orchestration**: Managed through Docker Compose
- **Service Isolation**: Each component runs in its dedicated container
- **Network Management**: Custom Docker networks for secure communication

### 🌐 Services Architecture

#### NGINX Server
- Operates as the main reverse proxy
- Routes incoming traffic to appropriate services
- Handles request distribution

#### Database Layer
- MariaDB implementation
- Persistent data storage
- Secure database operations

#### Application Layer
- WordPress service
- Containerized application deployment
- Scalable configuration

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Network Configuration
```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

### Security Measures
- Container isolation
- Network segmentation
- Service-specific access controls

### Performance Optimization
- Containerized services for resource efficiency
- Optimized NGINX configuration
- Database performance tuning

## 📈 Benefits
1. **Isolation**: Reduced service conflicts
2. **Scalability**: Easy service scaling
3. **Maintenance**: Simplified updates and modifications
4. **Security**: Enhanced through containerization
5. **Reliability**: Stable service operation

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up --build

# View running services
docker-compose ps

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## 📋 Requirements
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose
